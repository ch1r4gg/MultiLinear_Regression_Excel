1. Conducted predictive analytics on restaurant tipping behavior using regression analysis in Excel, with a focus on multi-linear regression.
2. Key independent variables identified were size and total bill, while categorical variables like sex, smoker, day, and time were excluded due to statistical insignificance.
3. Developed a prediction calculator to estimate tips based on significant factors, and assessed model performance using root mean square error (RMSE).
